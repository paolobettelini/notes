\section{Exercises}

\begin{snippetexercise}{homomorphism-ex1}{}
    Let \(G\) be an \abeliangroup and \(n\in\integers\).
    Prove that \(\varphi\colon G \to G\) defined as \(\varphi_n(x) = x^n\)
    is an endomorphism of \(G\).
    Is it true if \(G\) is not \abeliangroup[abelian]?
\end{snippetexercise}

\begin{snippetsolution}{homomorphism-ex1-sol}{}
    Let \(x,y\in G\). We know that \(\varphi_n(xy) = {(xy)}^n = x^n y^n = \varphi_n(x) \varphi_n(y)\).
    This, \(\varphi_n\) is an endomorphism.
    If \(G\) is not \abeliangroup[abelian], we note that \(\varphi_n\)
    is clearly an endomorphism for \(n=0,1\).
    For \(n=2\) we would need \({(xy)}^2 = xyxy\) to be equal to \(x^2y^2 = xxyy\).
    By cancellation \(yx = xy\), so for \(n=2\), \(\varphi_n\) is not an endomorphism.
    For \(n=3\) we get \(xyxyxy = xxxyyy\) meaning \(yxyx = xxyy\).
    The latter (even for bigger \(n\)) is true depending on \(G\).
    For example, if \(n=6\) and \(G = \permgrp_3\), given \(\sigma \in G\)
    we have \(n^6 = \identityfunc\).
\end{snippetsolution}

\begin{snippetexercise}{homomorphism-ex2}{}
    Let \(G = (\text{Inv}(\integers / 15), \cdot)\).
    Find the kernel and image of the endomorphism \(\theta({[a]}_{15}) \triangleq {[a]}_{15}^2\).
\end{snippetexercise}

\begin{snippetsolution}{homomorphism-ex2-sol}{}
    Note that \(\cardinality{Inv(\integers / 15)} = \eulertotient(15) = 8\).
    Those elements have form \({[a]}_15\) where \(\gcd(a, 15) = 1\). Thus,
    \(a = 1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14\). Their image with respect to \(\theta\) are
    respectively \({[1]}_{15}\), \({[4]}_{15}\), \({[1]}_{15}\), \({[4]}_{15}\), \({[4]}_{15}\), \({[1]}_{15}\), \({[4]}_{15}\), \({[1]}_{15}\).
    Thus,
    \[
        \image\{\theta\} = \{{[1]}_{15}, {[4]}_{15}\}
    \]
    and
    \[
        \grpker_\theta = \{{[1]}_{15}, {[4]}_{15}, {[11]}_{15}, {[14]}_{15}\}
    \]
\end{snippetsolution}

\begin{snippetexercise}{homomorphism-ex3}{}
    Let \(m,n\) nbe positive integers
    where \(m\) divides \(n\). Show that \(\varphi\colon \text{Inv}(\integers / n) \to \text{Inv}(\integers / m)\)
    defined as
    \[
        \varphi({[x]}_n) \triangleq {[x]}_m
    \]
    Show that \(\varphi\) is well-defined and it is a \grouphomomorphism.
\end{snippetexercise}

\begin{snippetsolution}{homomorphism-ex3-sol}{}
    In order to show that it is well-defined, we need to prove:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \({[x]}_n = {[y]}_n \implies {[x]}_m = {[y]}_m\):
        let \(x \equiv y \pmod{n}\), meaning \(x-y\) is a multiple of \(n\),
        which, in turn, is multiple of \(m\) and thus \(x-1\) is multiple of \(m\),
        meaning \(x \equiv y \pmod{m}\) and \({[x]}_m = {[y]}_m\).
        \item if \({[x]}_n\) is invertible, then \({[x]}_m\) is invertible:
        we know that \({[x]}_n\) is invertible \ifandonlyif \(x\) is \coprime with \(n\).
        Since \(m \divides n\), then \(m\) is also \coprime with \(x\).
        Thus, \({[x]}_m\) is invertible.
    \end{enumerate}
    We now show that \(\varphi\) is a \grouphomomorphism.
    \begin{align*}
        \varphi({[x]}_n \cdot {[y]}_n) &= \varphi({[xy]}_n)
        = {[xy]}_m = {[x]}_m {[y]}_n = \varphi({[x]}_n)\varphi({[x]}_n)
    \end{align*}
\end{snippetsolution}

\begin{snippetexercise}{homomorphism-ex4}{}
    Determine which of the following maps are \grouphomomorphism[group homomorphisms]:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\varphi\colon (\realnumbers^\exceptzero, \cdot) \fromto GL_2(\realnumbers)\)
        defined as
        \[
            \varphi(a) = \begin{pmatrix}
                a & 0 \\
                0 & 1
            \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        \item \(\varphi\colon (\realnumbers, +) \fromto GL_2(\realnumbers)\)
        defined as
        \[
            \varphi(a) = \begin{pmatrix}
                1 & 0 \\
                a & 1
            \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        \item \(\varphi\colon GL_2(\realnumbers) \fromto (\realnumbers^\exceptzero, \cdot)\)
        defined as
        \[
            \varphi\left(\begin{pmatrix}
                a & b \\
                c & d
            \end{pmatrix}\right) = ab
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{snippetexercise}

\begin{snippetsolution}{homomorphism-ex4-sol}{}
    Note that we first need to show that the maps are well-defined.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the mapping is invertible as \(\det(g) = a \neq 0\);
        \item  TODO
        \[
            {\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ a & 1\end{pmatrix}}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
                1 & 0 \\ -a & 1
            \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        \item the mapping is not well-defined. Example:
        \[
            \varphi\left(\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}\right) = 0    
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{snippetsolution}

\begin{snippetexercise}{homomorphism-ex5}{}
    Consider
    \[
        \varphi \colon \permgrp_3 \fromto (\integers / 6, +)
    \]
    such that \(\varphi(\kcycle{1,2}) = {[3]}_6\) and 
    \(\varphi(\kcycle{1,2,3}) = {[2]}_6\).
    Can this be a \grouphomomorphism?
\end{snippetexercise}

\begin{snippetsolution}{homomorphism-ex5-sol}{}
    Note that the element \(\kcycle{1,2}\)
    has period \(2\) and is sent into an element of period \(2\).
    The same goes for the other element of period \(3\).
    The periods are thus respected.
    The image must contain \({[2]}_6\)
    and \({[3]}_6\).
    Since \(|\permgrp_3| = |\integers / 6|\), \(\varphi\)
    should also be \injective and thus a \groupisomorphism.
    However, \(\permgrp_3\) and \(\integers / 6\) are not isomorphic as
    one is \abeliangroup[abelian] and the other is not.
    Thus, \(\varphi\) is not a \grouphomomorphism.
    Indeed, those two are essentially the only two \group[groups]
    of order \(6\).
