\begin{snippetcharacter}{atonement-briony-tallis}{Briony Tallis}
    The protagonist of the story and thirteen years old at the beginning of the novel. Briony is a precocious and talented child, although she is also stubborn, self-centered, and arrogant. Upon spending time with her slightly older cousin, Lola, Briony longs to be more grown-up. Having written stories since the age of eleven, Briony sees everything through the lens of a story and attempts to make sense of the world in that way. As an adult, Briony gives up her plan of going to Cambridge to work as a trainee nurse to punish herself for her crime. Briony eventually becomes a successful novelist.

Cecilia loves Robbie and vows to wait for him after he is wrongfully arrested.
